This is Ultimate Trash, the post modern vision of TomyTronic's Scrabmle from the 80's.
During final project week at the Spiced Academy bootcamp, I was thinking of what to build.
The game I used to play at my grandfather's when I was a bairn, and never since, came to mind.
And that was basically it...

You play as Keanu Reeves spinning through a world trash bags, with one goal... to spread love.
Enemies include minions, Ruby Rhods and Nicholas Cage heads.
Can you clear a path to the final boss?
